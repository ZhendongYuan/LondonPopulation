# VGI2Pop
VGI2Pop is one open-sourced and adapted dasymteric mapping method which can downscale the urban population from coarse census tracks or administrative units into neighborhood (street block scale) considering the scale effect. Two popular voluntary geographic information (VGI) data sets are involved. They are open street map (OSM) and twitter data. 

The micro-urban structure features extracted from OSM and user's locations of twitter data can better represent the distribution of urban population. Moreover, we found that scale effect ignored by the conventional dasymetrci mapping methods limits the perdiction accuracy.
We proposed to apply the domain adaptation techniques to mitigate the scale effect and the result shows that our VGI2Pop can outperform than broadly used dasymetric mapping.
