## Experiment 2: Overall performance of VGI2Pop
The performance of two popular dasymetric mapping methods are compared to VGI2Pop in this folder namely multiclass_dasy and RF_LULC. 
Our proposed VGI2Pop achieved 71.4% higher aggregated accuracy than the conventional multi-class dasymetric mapping method and 48.8% higher than the random forest method based on land use and land cover data.
